Assignment using VB for grade 10 Computer Science
Final Assignment: Student Grading System

Objective:
The goal of this assignment is to demonstrate your understanding and ability to apply the key programming concepts you have learned so far, including conditional statements, loops, and procedures/functions. You will be tasked with implementing a **Student Grading System** that processes input for multiple students, calculates grades, and displays detailed reports.

Assignment Details:
You are required to write a Visual Basic (VB) program that meets the following criteria:
1. Student Input:
   - The program should prompt the user to input at least five student names.
   - For each student, the program should accept three individual scores (e.g., Math, English, and Science) as input.

2. Grading Logic:
   - Calculate the total score for each student by summing the scores for the three subjects.
   - Calculate the average score for each student by dividing the total score by the number of subjects.
   - Assign a grade based on the average score using the following criteria:
-	Grade A: Average ≥ 90
-	Grade B: Average ≥ 75
-	Grade C: Average ≥ 60
-	Grade D: Average ≥ 50
-	Grade F: Average < 50
   - Utilize if...else if...else statements to determine and assign the grade.

3. Display Information:
   - After calculating the grade for each student, display the following:
-	Student Name
-	Total Score
-	Average Score
-	Grade
-	Grade-specific Message (e.g., "Excellent!", "Good Job", "Needs Improvement").
   - Use a select case statement to display the appropriate message based on the grade.

4. Iteration:
   - Use a For Loop to process input and calculate grades for each student.
   - Use a While Loop to ask the user if they wish to enter data for more students. The loop should continue until the user opts out (e.g., answers "no").
   - Use a Do...Until loop to ensure that valid scores (between 0 and 100) are entered for each student. If invalid input is provided, prompt the user to re-enter the score.

5. Procedures and Functions:
   - Implement a function to calculate the average score for a student.
   - Implement a procedure to display each student’s information (name, total score, average score, grade, and grade-specific message).

Submission Instructions:
- Submit the source code of your VB program via the provided submission link.
- Ensure your code is well-organized, commented, and easy to follow.
- The program should handle edge cases, such as invalid input or incorrect data formats, by prompting the user to re-enter the data.

Evaluation Criteria:
- Correct use of loops (For, While, Do...Until).
- Proper implementation of conditional statements (if...else if...else, select case).
- Accurate calculation of total, average, and grade.
- Effective use of functions and procedures.
- Clean, readable, and well-commented code.

Challenge Note:
This assignment is designed to challenge your ability to integrate all the key programming concepts covered during the course. Pay attention to the structure of your program, and test it thoroughly to ensure it functions correctly. Good luck!
